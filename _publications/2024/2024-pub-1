abstract: >-
 We propose a lightweight real-time gait event detection method using inertial sensors. 
 Four key gait events are accurately identified based on angular velocity features, with mean errors under 20â€¯ms. 
 The method was validated on data from both healthy and recovering individuals, showing strong potential for clinical and rehabilitation use.
