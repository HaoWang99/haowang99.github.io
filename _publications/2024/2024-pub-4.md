  This study proposes a lightweight multi-sensor gait recognition method with attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and reduce model complexity. 
  By evaluating sensor placements and fusion strategies, the most effective combinations and data-level fusion are identified. 
  The method shows strong robustness and efficiency across different subject scales, enhancing practicality in real-world applications.
