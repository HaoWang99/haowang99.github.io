  This study presents an interpretable machine learning approach for real-time energy expenditure prediction in running, based on demographics, physical activity, and physiological features. A total of 743 hand-crafted features were selected to train models including LR, KNN, RF, and GBR, with gradient-boosted regression achieving the best performance (CC=0.970, RMSE=1.004, MAE=0.729). The results demonstrate the methodâ€™s accuracy and practical potential for wearable fitness monitoring.
